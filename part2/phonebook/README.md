# Phonebook Frontend

My first full stack application. Frontend was created with React and uses Axios to communicate with the backend. The frontend state is managed with State Hooks. The styling was done with Material-UI.

The backend data is stored in a Collection in MongoDB and then Node.js uses Mongoose to model that data.

Some notable features of this application are:
  *  Utilization of HTTP Request Methods
  *  Ability for user to add and delete people
  *  Search box that allows user to find a specific person
